	 * This is a free will assignment for you to have fun with what we have learned.
	 * 
	 * I want you to tell me a story using the following things:
	 * - Your own protagonist POJO.
	 * -- Provide three attributes to this POJO and two overloaded constructors besides the
	 * no args constructor.
	 * - Feel free to add more characters to your story.
	 * - An Interface and an Abstract Class which your POJO(s) will implement and/or extend.
	 * -- Add some fun methods in there.
	 * - Two custom exceptions, one extending from Exception and the other one extending
	 * from RuntimeException. These will be thrown in the story.
	 * 
	 * In the main method is where you tell the story. You can create as many instances
	 * (characters) as you need, but make you sure you present them into the console before
	 * starting the story.
	 * 
	 * Remember, I want you to have fun, BUT AS ALWAYS... Keep it professional.
	 * 
	 * P.S.: Don't forget to have this assignment under Java_Assignments folder.
